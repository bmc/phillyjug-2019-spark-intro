Materials from 2019 Intro to Spark talk at Philly JUG

The DBC file with the notebooks is `notebooks.dbc`. Click on it,
and you should be able to download it. Then, follow
[these instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/notebooks/notebook-manage.html#import-an-archive)
to import the notebook into a Databricks workspace. If you don't have
access to a Databricks workspace, you can use
[Databricks Community Edition](https://databricks.com/ce),
which is free.

You'll also need the data. See the first notebook (`00-Intro`) for details
on how to get the data.
